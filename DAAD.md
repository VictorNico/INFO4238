the main problem that we try to resolve is in common of time, all project use database, which can be big to be understand by the user line by line. Otherwise, the control access to data can be not well implement because we can try to access a data and the result can be big and hard to read.
the idea is to split up firstly the global vue database into some least databases that we call microservices. Then give access only to who have a granted access.
split into some microservices is the best idea because you system stay asynchronuous, not wait of direct response, least of requestes and best database managment. Each time that a microservice or a center database have and update, all the other services will receive the update.

## object oriented modeling

## formalisation to a graph

## graph transformation

## graph languages

> * graph schema is a set of graph transformation
> * graph language is a set of graphs that can be created through a sequence transformation call
> * word problem aka parsing ... "efficient"

## graph synchronisation

## microservice synchronisation

## bidirection model transformations

## model synchronisation
define somes micorservices laws
+ "easy" graph languages
+ 
> verified consistency
